## About melonJS:

melonJS is an open source HTML5 game engine that empowers developers and designers to focus on content. The framework provides a collection of composable entities and support for a number of third-party tools. It gives you a powerful combination that can be used wholesale or piecemeal.

MelonJS works standalone, without needing additional libraries, and just requiring an HTML5 capable browser. It is very small and fast enough to build 2D games with parallax backgrounds and multiple sprites at once.

## Factory Pattern Evaluation:

Factory pattern is a creational pattern and it provides one of the best ways to create an object. In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

Please find the link to the sample program I've implemeted for understanding factory patterns in java:
