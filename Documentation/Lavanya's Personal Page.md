## About melonJS:

melonJS is an open source HTML5 game engine that empowers developers and designers to focus on content. The framework provides a collection of composable entities and support for a number of third-party tools. It gives you a powerful combination that can be used wholesale or piecemeal.

MelonJS works standalone, without needing additional libraries, and just requiring an HTML5 capable browser. It is very small and fast enough to build 2D games with parallax backgrounds and multiple sprites at once.

## Evaluation:

1. Supported Platforms include Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, Android.

2. Underlying Language: Java script

3. Compatible with most major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera, IE) and mobile devices.

4. Forum support is available.

5. melonJS is free and open source.

# Week #2: Finalizing a game, understanding the base-line code and practising one design pattern.

## Game Finalized: Monkey Adventure

## Factory Pattern Evaluation:

Factory pattern is a creational pattern and it provides one of the best ways to create an object. In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

Please find the link to the sample program I've implemeted for understanding factory patterns in java:

# Week #3: Evaluating a new design pattern, designing activity diagram for the game.

1. Evaluated the Decorator design pattern which is useful for implementing a new game feature. 

    Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. This type       of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.

    Please find an example [here](https://www.journaldev.com/1540/decorator-design-pattern-in-java-example)
    
2. Suggested few new game names. We have to finalize appropriate name.
3. Found out bugs in the exisitng game which are updated in the GameAnalysis page.
4. Suggested some new features to be added into the game. Updated them in the GameAnalysis page.
5. Made an activity diagram based on the features we discussed(ActivityDiagram.asta file is added in Documentation). This will be modified when new features or modules are proposed and approved by the team.

# Week #4: 

1. Updated activity diagram for new modules/screens.
2. Started working on the background music bug.
3. Started analyzing UML class design for the selected pattern(Decorator).
4. Analyzed bug number 10 in Game Analysis.

# Week #5:

1. Added new backgrounds for new levels.
2. Started implementing Levels screen.
3. Adding more levels to the game by creating new worlds in greenfoot.
4. Analyse strategy design pattern for Levels module.
5. Solved the issues 59 and 52 in the taskboard.

# Week #6:

1. Activated the "Next Level" button at the end of each game.
2. Implemented "Next Level" functionality by using Singleton design pattern.
3. Created Levels screen for the game with three levels.
4. Worked on issues 50(in progress), 58 and 73.
5. Working on state of levels-showing lock and open based on eligibility for a particular level.
6. Started working on strategy design pattern for different levels.

#Week #7:

1. Integrated with other module(GameOverState.java and LevelCompletedState.java) for connection between levels.
2. Implementing Strategy design pattern for levels.
