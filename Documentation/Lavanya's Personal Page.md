## About melonJS:

melonJS is an open source HTML5 game engine that empowers developers and designers to focus on content. The framework provides a collection of composable entities and support for a number of third-party tools. It gives you a powerful combination that can be used wholesale or piecemeal.

MelonJS works standalone, without needing additional libraries, and just requiring an HTML5 capable browser. It is very small and fast enough to build 2D games with parallax backgrounds and multiple sprites at once.
