## User Stories based on V.1 list of features:

1. As a player, I want to monitor the health status of my monkey by looking at a nice bar, so that I can get motivated to play better and engage more into the game.

2. As a player, I want to make my monkey powered up / immune for some time by collecting hearts, so that I can increase my chances of getting to the end of the current Saga i.e. level of the game.
