1. As a player, I want to monitor the health status of my monkey by looking at a nice bar, so that I can get motivated to play better and engage more into the game.

2. As a player, I want to make my monkey powered up / immune for some time by collecting hearts, so that I can increase my chances of getting to the end of the current Saga i.e. level of the game.

3. As a player, I want to have several levels i.e "Saga"s to accomplish, so that I can experience various worlds / adventures in the game.

4. As a player, I want to have a clear criteria to finish the game, so that I am able to reach the end of the game at some point.

5. As a player, I want to have multiple lives for my monkey, so that I don't have to start a whole new game from scratch in case I lose one of my lives.
