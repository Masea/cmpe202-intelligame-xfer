**Eliminate Waste**

In week #7, Our aim for this week was to eliminate wrong features, backlog items, unnecessarily complex solutions. Partially done worka and defects. We analysed all the exisiting waste available in our development and waste removel is done iteratively until even seemingly essential processes and procedures are liquidated. 


**Communication**

In Week #1, our team had discussed on what the requirements are and divided the tasks individually. Each of us had planned to explore different game engines and to come up with ideas that could be integrated later. At the end of the week, we've evaluated different game engines based on their complexity, technology stack used and supported platforms. Finally, we've shared our ideas and views about each game engine. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

In Week #2, our team had finalized the game engine(Greenfoot) and the game(Monkey Adventure) to be implemented. We've brainstormed the features/modules to be added into the game. We have taken the baseline code and tried to understand the same by testing it. Each of us have analyzed one design pattern by implementing an example. We've discussed on how to fit a particular design pattern into a specific module. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

In Week #3, our team had brainstormed and proposed many new features to be added into the game. We discussed about design patterns that will fit into different game modules. We divided the task of implementing different design patterns for different features. Apart from this, we identified several bugs in the existing game which will be corrected in the coming weeks. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

In Week#4, our team had discussed on different modules/screens to be added into the game. Different screens finalized are:
* Menu screen
* Score Board
* Keyboard shortcuts (Help option)
* Play game
* Purchase screen
* Types of Purchase options
* Different levels
* Celebration page

For each of these screens, we've decided to implement appropriate design patterns. We've managed to fix some of the bugs identified previously and should work on the remaining in the coming weeks. We've decided to take up one screen from above and start developing that. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

In week #5, we as team started to communicate more effectively and decided upon a feasible time frame that is manageable to everyone. Zoom meetings as a mode of communication was also practiced so that the entire team can work around their schedule. We've decided to implement the game in separate modules(one module for each member) and decided on the design patterns. As we came across different design patterns in this week, we tried to map them to various new functionalities. We've started fixing bugs and developing new functionalities. We've also discussed on how to maintain the Sprint task sheet. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

In week #6, each of us worked on different modules assigned. We coordinated whenever there is a dependency with other modules. Once the dependencies are understood, we continued working on our individual modules. We started implemeting the design patterns and also started working on the UML class design. We had discussed and resolved known bugs. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

In week #7, we continued working on modules assigned to each of us and started making the final changes. We started integrating the code and correcting errors if any. We are working on integrating class diagrams of different modules into a single project class diagram. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

**Simplicity**

In week #1, each team member did a PoC to test out the functionalties of the Game engine. This code might not be used in the actual product but it helped the other team members to understand the game engine in a better way.

In week #4,
It’s important that as developers we understand that models are critical for simplifying both software and the software process—it’s much easier to explore an idea, and improve upon it as your understanding increases, by drawing a diagram or two instead of writing tens or even hundreds of lines of code. We as a team drew activity diagram, wireframes, usecase diagram, sequence diagram to bring about this simplicity.

In week #6
We brought about simplicity in our integration methoddology by creating modules. So that there is less dependency and more isolated tasks.

**Feedback** 
In week #1, Our team has worked on finding suitable game as our project. We have evaluated scope of several game engines, with the mutual feedback on gathered ideas considering design and implementation, we came up with one game engine on which we will develop our game. Through constant feedback, we are continuously planning to improve, revise our practices and adjust our project going forward.

In week #2, Every team member came up with different ideas on game based on greenfoot. After gathering their individual ideas, we finalized one game Monkey Adventure. We are improving our practices, this week we have improved collaboration among team memebers. Also, we have discussed improvement needed in game baseline code, which team will implement as the project goes forward. 
Goal is to make very short feedback loops to show the development continuously. So we demonstrated our game early and will make necessary changes.

In week #3, We are countinuosly improving our software by resolving existing bugs of baseline code. We will implement new features in upcoming weeks though. We gave feedback to each other on suggested design patterns and selected five design patterns for now and have started working on that individually. We are working on making a bug free game by implementing test driven practices.

In week #4, Every week we try to improve our process. This week we improved collaboration of each team member for building the project and started working productively. We made changes in software to deliver it earliest by fixing bugs and adding functionalities. Our game has a base template now and we are speeding up our project. We are cpuntinuously working on making design using UML. Our team has completed Use Case spec, Activity diagram, wireframe, Sequence diagram and User stories. Now in the next week we will implement design patterns to make code better.
We as a team, take frequent meetings to give feedback on each other tasks and find improvement areas to work on.

In week #5, We have improved our pace for finishing the game. We all are working on different modules, but we kept others informed with our changes so that it will not affect their code respectively. We improved our communication more, as we are frequently taking team meetings, everybody suggested their ideas to implement patterns. Team members are synced up with other's module. It would help them to take feedback from other team members.

In week #6, We have gathered various ideas to make the new enhancement in our Project. All team members gave their suggestions to reduce the bugs and new design patterns that can be applied. We have improved our working process and gave more effort to building this game.

In week #7, With every new use case/story being created, the team immediately reverted with timeline estimation, firming up requirements as they arose.

**Courage**
In week #1, We learned about many game engines and tried to implement simple example games. We came to know that each game engine have its pros and cons. We implemented many simple example games to understand the architecture and working of different engines but we were not afraid to discard the effort and code as many game engines didn't provide what we were looking for. 

In week #2, We implemented many design patterns and tried to solve some example problems with them. We also searched for many existing games to work upon. As being in reasearch phase, We invested much of our time and effort in these. But as its required, We kept doing it and finally decided which game to develop and which design patterns to use in developmet.

In week #3,
Courage is important because you need to make important decisions and be able to change direction by either discarding or refactoring your work when some of your decisions prove inadequate.We as a team showed courage by effectively putting out points which were adding unwanted complexity to the code.

In week #4, Everyone took leads to their own design patterns. We are finding it hard to where to implement it in code and how. Many failed attempts but still everyone keeps trying.
 
In week #5, Everyone started creating prototype for individual assigned modules. Though everyone have faced many challenges, We kept trying to implement.

In week #6, Everyone has worked on assigned design pattern. It seems tought to wire in the new designed code into existing baseline code. Even though it is diffult, We are trying hard to get it done. 

In week #7, Everyone had spend significant times to implement the assiged design patterns but some of us includingme finding it hard to be integrate it with baseline code. We will now start working on creating class diagram of the code.

**Respect**
In week #1, The IntelliGame team were respectful to each others' points of views and knowledge as a valued team member. Every team member evaluated a different game engine, and presented their results to the team, discussing all the cons and pros. Every one respected opposite opinions, and made their best effort to leverage our diverse perspectives and reasoning.  As a development team, we accepted responsibility and received authority over our work.

In Week #2, our team had finalized the game engine (Greenfoot) to be used, as well as the game itself (Monkey Adventure) to be implemented. We discussed possible features of the game, and tried to understand and test the baseline code, and functionalities. We have taken the baseline code and tried to understand the same by testing it. All the above were done by several discussions among the team members, and we all listened and respected each others' points of view.

In Week #3, we brainstormed and proposed many new features to be added into the game. We discussed about design patterns that will fit into different game modules. We divided the task of implementing different design patterns for different features. Moreover, each of us found some bugs in the existing code, and made sure to respect others by discussing it with them to reach to a common grounf before going forward in fixing the bugs. We successfully resoved all the bugs that we found so far.

In Week#4, we discussed the different parts of the game UI and wireframe thoroughly. Every team member has some new ideas, and we acheived a nice outcome by keeping our discussions and meeting always to the point and respectfull to other team members. 

In week #5, we as team showed respect for every team members' time by meeting online using Zoom, and agreed upon a time frame that would work for all team members. We discussed different options and chandeg the architecture of the game slightly.

In week #6, IntelliGame team members continued developing the modules assigned to them while communicating any discrepancies faced in the classes shared between two or more team members while recognizing and respecting others' efforts and trying to reach to a common ground rather than insisting on their own point of view.

In week #7, our team members finalized the implementation of their assigned design patterns and together integrated the modules, first independently, and then together,taking into account the parts of their modules that affect other team members' modules, and any inter-modul classes that had any kind of dependency to another modul's class(es). Each of us discussed the effects of other team members' code on our own, and resolved issues while remaining respectfull to each others' opinions and acknowledging their efforts.
