**# Communication**
(Lavanya)

In Week #1, our team had discussed on what the requirements are and divided the tasks individually. Each of us had planned to explore different game engines and to come up with ideas that could be integrated later. At the end of the week, we've evaluated different game engines based on their complexity, technology stack used and supported platforms. Finally, we've shared our ideas and views about each game engine. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

In Week #2, our team had finalized the game engine(Greenfoot) and the game(Monkey Adventure) to be implemented. We've brainstormed the features/modules to be added into the game. We have taken the baseline code and tried to understand the same by testing it. Each of us have analyzed one design pattern by implementing an example. We've discussed on how to fit a particular design pattern into a specific module. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

In Week #3, our team had brainstormed and proposed many new features to be added into the game. We discussed about design patterns that will fit into different game modules. We divided the task of implementing different design patterns for different features. Apart from this, we identified several bugs in the existing game which will be corrected in the coming weeks. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

In Week#4, our team had discussed on different modules/screens to be added into the game. Different screens finalized are:
* Menu screen
* Score Board
* Keyboard shortcuts (Help option)
* Play game
* Purchase screen
* Types of Purchase options
* Different levels
* Celebration page

For each of these screens, we've decided to implement appropriate design patterns. We've managed to fix some of the bugs identified previously and should work on the remaining in the coming weeks. We've decided to take up one screen from above and start developing that. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

**# Simplicity**
(Dhanashree)

In week #1, each team member did a PoC to test out the functionalties of the Game engine. This code might not be used in the actual product but it helped the other team members to understand the game engine in a better way.

**# Feedback** 
(Ambika)

In week #1, Our team has worked on finding suitable game as our project. We have evaluated scope of several game engines, with the mutual feedback on gathered ideas considering design and implementation, we came up with one game engine on which we will develop our game. Through constant feedback, we are continuously planning to improve, revise our practices and adjust our project going forward.

In week #2, Every team member came up with different ideas on game based on greenfoot. After gathering their individual ideas, we finalized one game Monkey Adventure. We are improving our practices, this week we have improved collaboration among team memebers. Also, we have discussed improvement needed in game baseline code, which team will implement as the project goes forward. 
Goal is to make very short feedback loops to show the development continuously. So we demonstrated our game early and will make necessary changes.

In week #3, We are countinuosly improving our software by resolving existing bugs of baseline code. We will implement new features in upcoming weeks though. We gave feedback to each other on suggested design patterns and selected five design patterns for now and have started working on that individually. We are working on making a bug free game by implementing test driven practices.

In week #4, We improved communication between each members and started working productively. We made changes in software to deliver it earliest. Our game has a base template now and we are speeding up our project. We are cpuntinuously working on making design using UML. Our team has completed Use Case spec, Activity diagram, wireframe, Sequence diagram and User stories. Now in the next week we will implement design patterns to make code better.
We as a team, take frequent meetings to give feedback on each other tasks and find improvement areas to work on.

**# Courage**
(Niyat)

In week #1, We learned about many game engines and tried to implement simple example games. We came to know that each game engine have its pros and cons. We implemented many simple example games to understand the architecture and working of different engines but we were not afraid to discard the effort and code as many game engines didn't provide what we were looking for. 

In week #2, We implemented many design patterns and tried to solve some example problems with them. We also searched for many existing games to work upon. As being in reasearch phase, We invested much of our time and effort in these. But as its required, We kept doing it and finally decided which game to develop and which design patterns to use in developmet.
 
**# Respect**
(Masi)

In week #1, The IntelliGame team were respectful to each others' points of views and knowledge as a valued team member. Every team member evaluated a different game engine, and presented their results to the team, discussing all the cons and pros. Every one respected opposite opinions, and made their best effort to leverage our diverse perspectives and reasoning.  As a development team, we accepted responsibility and received authority over our work.
