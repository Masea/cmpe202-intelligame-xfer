## Week #1:

Questions:
1.  What did the team do the past week?
2.  What is the team going to do next week?
3.  What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
 
Answers:

1. In the past week, our team had worked on evaluating the scope of different game engines. We evaluated various game engines like Phaser, Greenfoot, Unity, MelonJs and Unreal. We've created separate wiki pages for each game engine to jot down the results of our evaluation. We have discussed pros and cons of each game engine based on supported platforms, underlying technology stack, complexity, supported IDEs and reviews on the respective forums. Also, each member did a PoC (using open source games) on the respective game engine to understand the complexity and implementation.

2. In the next week, we have to zero in on one game engine. After doing that, we're planning to explore games in that particular game engine. We shall discuss and decide on which game is to be finalized. We shall also study design patterns and figure out what design pattern could be implemented in our project.

3. We found it challenging to zero in on one game engine as we liked several game engines like unity and greenfoot.

## Week #2:

Questions:
1.  What did the team do the past week?
2.  What is the team going to do next week?
3.  What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?

Answers:

1. In the past week, after researching our different options for the game engine, the team decided to implement a game using Greenfoot game engine. We studied several open source games implemented with greenfoot, and agreed on using the Mr.Monkey game as the baseline code, considering its potentials for adding variety of modules, that would allow us implement several design patterns in our project. Also each of us took a different design pattern, evaluated and understood it by implementing an example. 

2. The Team will agree on the features that are going to be implemented in the game. After that every team member will study one or two of those feature(s), and decide using which design pattern that option should be implemented with. We are also going to discuss the design and architechture of the project, but the more detailed discussion and decision will take place in Week#3.

3. As we are in inceptive phase of game development, We are not stuck with any challenging task at this stage. At start of week, we found it challenging to select game that suits our requirement but after we implemented many and many sample games we got better clear idea and finally zeroed on single game.
