# Finalizing a game, understanding the base-line code and practising one design pattern

Finalized game : Monkey adventure

# Observer design Pattern

1. One-to-many dependency between objects.
2. One object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
3. Subject is an object which is being watched and observers or listeners are the objects which are watching the state changes.
