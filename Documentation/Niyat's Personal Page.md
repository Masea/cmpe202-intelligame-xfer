# 4 Agile Core Values

## 1. Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools
People is values more rather than process or tools as the people are the ones who will eventually responds to business requirements and needs. If process or tools drives the development, people will become less respondus and less like to meet the needs of customer. Communication is the example of difference between valuing individual vs process. In case of individuals, Communication is more prompt and done when needed. While in case of process, It requires scheduling.

## 2. Working software over Comprehensive Documentation
Historic developments tend to Documents a lot and required detailing of very small events or functions of the project. It hinders the developments. While Agile doesn't eliminates the documentation but try to maintain it minimal and only as much as required. This makes development quicker. Agile developments give preference to working software rather than comprehensive documentation.

## 3. Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation
In a Simple SDSL life cycle development, Customer specifies all the requirements and details before any development starts. Customer is not involved during the process of development. Agile manifesto describes customer who is engaged and collaborates during development. This makes easier for developers to meet the needs of customer.

## 4. Responding to Change Over Following a Plan
In traditional development, Change in need regarded as an expense and thus avoided. The intention in traditional development is to develop detailed plan of everything - having highest priority of anything else. In Agile, Developments are done through iterations and new development needs can be accommodated in next iteration. In Agile methodology it a belief that change always improves the product and thus are always welcomed.
