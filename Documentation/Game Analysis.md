## About the game:

## Existing features:

1. Monkey can walk and jump forward.
2. If monkey touches dustbin or cactus, then game is over.
3. Monkey can collect bananas and each banana is a score point.
4. Score board is available on top right.

## Existing bugs:

1. Not a smooth finish of the game. [fixed]
2. No option to "Play game" or starting a game. [fixed]
3. Background music is running continuously. It should not start if game has not started. [fixed]
5. Props and monkey size should be small compared to background. [fixed]
6. Monkey should not be killed, once he touches prop. His health status should be decreased by X%. [fixed]
7. Left button is not working, monkey should go back when left button is pressed. [fixed]
8. Decrease the jump width (x parameter).[fixed]
9. Once game is over, it should redirect to "Try again" or "Quit". [fixed]
10. Change the background and props to make it visually attractive. [fixed]
11. Even after the game is over, monkey moves till it reaches ground if the run button is pressed without reset. [fixed]
12. There are a total of 41 bananas in the game. Even if we miss collecting one banana, the final score is still 41. Score should be adjusted depending on the number of bananas collected. [fixed]
13. Music should stop if the game is paused for easy identification. 

## New features planned to be implemented:

1. Adding health status and showing monkey's health status in a different bar. [done]
2. Adding more levels into the game (levels to be called "Saga" in our game i.e. The Adventur Saga, The War Saga, The Power Saga, The Marathon Saga, and so on). [in process]
3. Giving more lifes and improve score board for displaying life and score both. [done]
4. As the levels progress, increase the difficuly of the game by placing more dustbins/cactus. 
5. Change the background/ look and feel of every level. [done]
6. Adding different fun voices for whenever the monkey eats different kinds of items i.e. banana, other regular fruits, heart (immunity), spark (power), rotten fruits (weakness).  [done]
