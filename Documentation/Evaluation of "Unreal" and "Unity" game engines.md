[UnityEngine](https://unity3d.com/) and [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog) are two most used Game engines in the industry. Unity is for small to medium size game development while unreal is large game development. We can make incredibly awesome graphics intensive game with unreal but for smaller games it is way more difficult to develop. Unity on the other hand light weight game engine and very easy to develop.

## Evaluation of Unreal:
1. Language: UnrealScript(UScript) and C++
2. Difficult to implement but community is very active and support is also very good.
3. Deployment is paid
4. Supported Platforms: Windows PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, VR (including but not limited to SteamVR/HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR, Google VR/Daydream, OSVR and Samsung Gear VR), Linux, SteamOS, and HTML5. You can run the Unreal Editor on Windows, OS X and Linux.
