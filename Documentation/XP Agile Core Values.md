## Agile Manifesto

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

* Working software over comprehensive documentation.

* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

* Responding to change over following a plan.

## Extreme Programming

Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development framework that aims to produce higher quality software, and higher quality of life for the development team. XP is the most specific of the agile frameworks regarding appropriate engineering practices for software development.


"Extreme Programming turns the conventional software process sideways. Rather than planning, analyzing, and designing for the 
far-flung future, XP programmers do all of these activities a little 
at a time throughout development.”
-- IEEE Computer , October 1999

## Core Values of XP 

### Communication

Extreme Programming emphasizes value of communication in its practices. It favors pair programming, user stories, daily stand-ups, collective ownership, etc.simple designs, common metaphors, collaboration of user and programmers, frequent verbal communication, and feedback. The purpose is to give all a shared view of the system.

### Simplicity

XP encourages starting with the simplest solution. It can be modified later according to the functionality requirement. This is sometimes summed up as the "You aren't gonna need it" (YAGNI) approach. The goal is to improve communication, as simple design could be easily understood by other programmers in the team.

### Feedback

Feedback should be invited at different time scales. Unit test tells programmers state of  the system. Programmers produces releases every 2-3 weeks for customer to review. The team estimates time required to implement changes on user stories. 

### Courage

Team have the courage to accept feedback and flaws in system. They have courage to throw the obsolete code away and re-factor the system architecture.

### Respect

Everyone gives and feels respect they deserve as a valued team member. Developers respect the expertise of the customers and vice versa. Management respects the team’s right to accept responsibility and receive authority over their work.
