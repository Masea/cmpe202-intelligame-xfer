IntelliGame is a web-based fun and interactive game that is currently under development at [[Computer Engineering Department|https://cmpe.sjsu.edu/]]  of [[San Jose State University|http://www.sjsu.edu/]]. It is a team project for the graduate course "CMPE-202 Software Systems Engineering" instructed by [[Paul Nguyen|https://github.com/paulnguyen/]] during Fall 2017. 

IntelliGame is going to be developed within an 8-week plan. Two different agile methodologies are going to be practiced during this project: Kanban for the first half, and Scrum for the second half.
