# Week #2: Finalizing a game, understanding the base-line code and practising one design pattern.

## Game Finalized: Monkey Adventure

## Chain of Responsibilty: [source](https://www.journaldev.com/1617/chain-of-responsibility-design-pattern-in-java)

1.The Chain of Responsibility is known as a behavioural pattern,as it's used to manage algorithms, relationships and responsibilities between objects. Thedefinition of Chain of Responsibility provided in the original Gang of Four book on DesignPatterns states: 

2.Gives more than one object an opportunity to handle a request by linking receiving objects together. 

3.Chain of Responsibility allows a number of classes to attempt to handle a request, independently of any other object along the chain. Once the request is handled, it completes it's journey through the chain.

4.One of the great example of Chain of Responsibility pattern is ATM Dispense machine.

# Week #3

1. Finalize game name

2. Find out bugs in existing game :
   Worked on finding existing bugs and how to remove those bugs for smooth operation. All the bugs found has been listed in "game analysis" page. 
   
3. Decide new features for the game :
   Suggested features for the game and made a list of those in "game analysis" page. Analysis done to add different design patterns for new features.
   
4. Make a wire frame :
   Made the wireframe of game interface using adobe creative cloud tool.

# Week #4

1. Updated wireframe diagram for new modules/screens.
2. Started working on "once game is over, it should redirect 'Try again' or 'Quit'".
3. Started analyzing UML class design for the selected pattern(Decorator).
4. Analyzed bug number 39,40 in Game Analysis.

# Week #5:

1. Started working on authentiction screen.
2. Analyzed which design patterns will fit the scenario.
3. Made a base code for authentication design pattern.

# Week #6:

1. Created a screen for user Authentication screen.
2. Activate "enter user pin" functionality for authentication screen.
3. Working on implementing observer design pattern for authentication screen.
