# Week #2: Finalizing a game, understanding the base-line code and practising one design pattern.

## Game Finalized: Monkey Adventure

## Chain of Responsibilty: [source](https://www.journaldev.com/1617/chain-of-responsibility-design-pattern-in-java)

1.The Chain of Responsibility is known as a behavioural pattern,as it's used to manage algorithms, relationships and responsibilities between objects. Thedefinition of Chain of Responsibility provided in the original Gang of Four book on DesignPatterns states: 

2.Gives more than one object an opportunity to handle a request by linking receiving objects together. 

3.Chain of Responsibility allows a number of classes to attempt to handle a request, independently of any other object along the chain. Once the request is handled, it completes it's journey through the chain.

4.One of the great example of Chain of Responsibility pattern is ATM Dispense machine.
