Week #1:

1.  What did the team do the past week?
2.  What is the team going to do next week?
3.  What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
 

In the past week, our team had worked on evaluating the scope of different game engines. We evaluated various game engines like Phaser, Greenfoot, Unity, MelonJs and Unreal. We've created separate wiki pages for each game engine to jot down the results of our evaluation. We have discussed pros and cons of each game engine based on supported platforms, underlying technology stack, complexity, supported IDEs and reviews on the respective forums. Also, each member did a PoC (using open source games) on the respective game engine to understand the complexity and implementation.

In the next week, we have to zero in on one game engine. After doing that, we're planning to explore games in that particular game engine. We shall discuss and decide on which game is to be finalized. We shall also study design patterns and figure out what design pattern could be implemented in our project.

We found it challenging to zero in on one game engine as we liked several game engines like unity and greenfoot.
