**# Communication**
(Lavanya)

In Week #1, our team had discussed on what the requirements are and divided the tasks individually. Each of us had planned to explore different game engines and to come up with ideas that could be integrated later. At the end of the week, we've evaluated different game engines based on their complexity, technology stack used and supported platforms. Finally, we've shared our ideas and views about each game engine. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

In Week #2, our team had finalized the game engine(Greenfoot) and the game to be implemented. We've brainstormed the features/modules to be added into the game. We have taken the baseline code and tried to understand the same by testing it. Each of us have analyzed one design pattern by implementing an example. We've discussed on how to fit a particular design pattern into a specific module. We're working together on creating the best solution possible.

**# Simplicity**
(Dhanashree)

In week #1, each team member did a PoC to test out the functionalties of the Game engine. This code might not be used in the actual product but it helped the other team members to understand the game engine in a better way.

**# Feedback** 
(Ambika)

In week #1, Our team has worked on finding suitable game as our project. We have evaluated scope of several game engines, with the mutual feedback on gathered ideas considering design and implementation, we came up with one game engine on which we will develop our game. Through constant feedback, we are continuously planning to improve, revise our practices and adjust our project going forward.

**# Courage**
(Niyat)

In week #1, We learned about many game engines and tried to implement simple example games. We came to know that each game engine have its pros and cons. We implemented many simple example games to understand the architecture and working of different engines but we were not afraid to discard the effort and code as many game engines didn't provide what we were looking for. 
 
**# Respect**
(Masi)

In week #1, The IntelliGame team were respectful to each others' points of views and knowledge as a valued team member. Every team member evaluated a different game engine, and presented their results to the team, discussing all the cons and pros. Every one respected opposite opinions, and made their best effort to leverage our diverse perspectives and reasoning.  As a development team, we accepted responsibility and received authority over our work.
